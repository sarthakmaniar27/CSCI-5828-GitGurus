## Reflection

# Implementation of the dashboard:

By developing on our idea and proposal, our team has completed a dashboard comprising of a geographical plot, a trend chart and a tree-map plot. We have incorporated all the features and plots, we had proposed initially.

According to the feedback from TA, we have updated our dashboard with the tree-map plot that wasn't done in milestone-2.

The left panel contains four filters that users can choose to filter by state, year range, crime type and the metric. The location filter helps the user select particular states. the selection is reflected in all the three plots. Multi-select has been enabled for this filter. By changing the year range, all the plots will only include the statistics for the corresponding input year range. Hence, users can choose a certain period that they are extremely interested in. By selecting the crime type, the plots only displays the trends for the input year range for that specific crime type. The crime type filter is also designed to be multi-select. Lastly, the metric filter will help the user select whether they want to visualise the actual numbers or if they want a crime rate per 100k people in the state.


# Thoughts on feedback

We primarily chose to work on Python over R because all of us were relatively more comfortable working in Python. 
We are grateful for the constructive feedback we have received through the course to improve our dashboard. Some very specific feedback such as the spacing, the working of filters etc taught us to look at the fine details. Other suggestions received such as making the state selection dynamic in the geographical plot, helped us develop on our ideas and in turn made our dashboard better and more responsive.

Improving on the complexity of the dashboard was one of the most common feedback items we recieved. We implemented the tree-map plot in Milestone-4 to address this feedback item (The tree-map plot was part of our initial proposal). Another recurring feedback item was to explain what the option "rate" in the metric filter meant. We have included this in the readme file and also intend to put it along with the dropdown.
