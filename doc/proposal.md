## Motivation and Purpose
Violence and crime plagues societies all over the world. It is an issue that almost all communities suffer from. America as one of the worldâ€™s superpower and an advanced nation is no exception. In some areas and in certain time periods, the prevalence of crime is much greater. Accounting for these findings is of extreme importance. If insights can be obtained into the processes that underlie these variations, then policy changes can be enacted accordingly. 
Crime statistics are important in understanding if government initiatives are working. 
They assist politicians in advocating for or against policies designed to tackle crime. They facilitate government agencies in making judgements on what is to be expected. To study these variations and try to understand some patterns, we propose to build a dashboard that tracks the violent crime statistics in various states of the USA from 1970-2015. Our app will show the overall trend of crime rates in the selected counties during the selected time period and also a breakdown of different crimes. 

## Description of the data
For this project, we will be using the city-crimes dataset collected as part of The Marshall Project. The dataset contains more than 40 years of data on the most serious violent crimes from 68 police jurisdictions. It has approximately 2800 records. Each record has information on the estimated population in that jurisdiction during that particular year. It has the number of violent crimes in each category and also the rate of crimes expressed as the number per 100k.

## Research questions and usage scenarios
The dashboard lets its users explore the trend of different types of violent crimes across states in the US during the period 1970-2015.

During the Recession in 2008, many people lost their jobs in the US. Did this lead to an increase in the crime rate?

Gun laws were brought into effect in a few states in the US. Did this help reduce the crime rate in those states?

An official in the criminal justice system, wants to know the efficacy rate of a scheme implemented to get criminal offenders into rehab and teach them some skills for a source of livelihood. This scheme was implemented three years ago. The criminal rates app will help the official get an overall view of the violent crime rate and also a breakdown by different violent crimes. He/She will be able to choose the police jurisdiction(s) and also the relevant years. They might observe that there is a considerable decrease in the number of robberies but homicides and other violent crimes continue to remain at the same rate. With this information, the government might be able to introduce more reforms to help decrease those crimes.
