## Reflection

# Implementation of the dashboard:

By developing our initial idea and proposal, our team has completed a dashboard comprising of a geographical plot and a trend chart. The dashboard is pretty close to our beginning sketch and has reached about 70% of the functionalities we proposed in milestone1.

According to the feedback from TA, we have updated our proposal with usage scenarios and a research question and the potential usage of the dashboard.

The left panel contains four filters that users can choose to filter by state, year range, crime type and the metric. The location filter affects the trend chart plot and users can choose the states that they want to see. Multi-select has been enabled for this filter. By changing the year range, both the plots will only include the statistics for the corresponding input year range. Hence, users can choose a certain period that they are extremely interested in. By selecting the crime type, the trend chart only displays the trends for the input year range for that specific crime type. The crime type filter is also designed to be multi-select. Lastly, the metric filter will help the user select whether they want to visualise the actual numbers or if they want a crime rate per 100k people in the state.

Currently, the geographical plot displays the violent crime rate corresponding to the selected year range. The trend chart uses all the fiters and displays the appropriate graphs when filtered by any of the parameters.


# Future improvements and additions for the dashboard:

There are still a few points our team may cover and enhance in the next milestone/implementation.

Some of the items pending from our intial proposal are:

- Implement a tree map to the left of the geograpahical plot with filtering by state, year range and metric

- Implement the crime and metric filter for the geographical plot.

- Implement a tooltip for the geographical plot to make it user friendly and have borders around states.

- Improve the user experience of the dashboard, and use more meaningful colour to interpret the processed data in the dashboard.
